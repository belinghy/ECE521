Task 1
1. Ran for settings in "task1_result_1.log"
2. Noticed validation error is not going back up
3. Realized that learning rate is too small (0.0001), with momentum 0.9
4. Remembered that we should use highest learning rate such that the numbers converge
5. Learning rate 0.001 converged
6. Learning rate 0.01 did not converge
7. Learning rate 0.005 did not converge
8. Ran "task1_results.log" with (0.001, 0.9)
